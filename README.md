## This idea in 152 characters
When determining equilibrium constants of multi-substrate / multi-product reactions, their ratios may affect the uncertainty of the result.

This is because usually the conversion of one pair is measured. This conversion has usually a constant error, which propagates into errors of different magnitude depending on the ratios of reactants. 


## How to Use
You are free to use this idea in whatever way you like. I put this material under CC-BY license, just to make it legally clear, but: "Gedanken sind frei" (ideas are free) -- I don't expect them to be protectable anyway.

## About this Farm of Ideas
This "Farm of Ideas" is supposed to store ideas I would like to develop into scientific progress some day, and to store their progression from initial idea being had, over keeping them alive, to growing them into something real and then "harvesting". 

If you are faster in developing them, I am happy with you and for the world! :) Just to avoid me having spend time on something you already realized then, I would be grateful for a short letting-me-know email.
